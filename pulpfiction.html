                Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are two hitmen who are out to
                retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Wallace has
                also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out a few days later when Wallace himself will be
                out of town. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his fight.
                The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny,
                bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.
